# Task-2--Spring-Boot
## Description
This project is a simple demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot.It provides
a basic example of how to implement these operations with a RESTful API for managing Book entities.

## Key Features:
  1) Create: Add new books to the database.
  2) Read: Retrieve book details and list all books.
  3) Update: Modify existing book details.
  4) Delete: Remove books from the database.
  This project is the first I have developed using Spring Boot and serves as an introduction to building RESTful APIs with
  this framework. It includes a basic structure with controller, model, and repository folders.
